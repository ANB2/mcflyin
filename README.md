###A timeseries transformation API built on Pandas and Flask

This is a small demo of an API to do timeseries transformations build on Flask and Pandas.

Concept
-------

The idea is that you can make a POST request to the API with a simple list/array of timestamps, from any language, and get back some interesting transformations of that data.

Why
---

Partly to show how straightforward it is to build such a thing. Python is great because it has very powerful, intuitive, quick-to-learn tools for both building web applications and doing data analysis/statistics.

That puts Python in kind of a unique position: powerful web tools, powerful scientific/numerical/statistical data tools. This API is a very simple example of how you can take advantage of both.
